### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ivan. A passionate webdeveloper.

Over the last few years I fell in love with [`Svelte`](https://svelte.dev/) and [`TypeScript`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

Since 2021 I'm also deeper involved in the topic of internationalization (`i18n`).\
Due to the lack of existing good solutions I have created a lightweight and fully typesafe solution that works in every `TypeScript` (and also `JavaScript`) project: [`typesafe-i18n`](https://github.com/ivanhofer/typesafe-i18n)
